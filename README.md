# Mockito Testing

## Description

This is a simple Weather API class testing using Mockito test. I created this project to demonstrate that testing code that retrieves information from external sources such as APIs and databases is both cool and possible without interfering with the API or the database. Tests should not call an API or attempt to retrieve information from a database.

## Installation

* 1- Install Git on your computer
* 2- Find and clone the repository from gitHub
* 3- Install the required dependencies or libraries.
* 4- Run the test class within the project.
